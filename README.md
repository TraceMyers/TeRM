Single-file MIT-licensed modules for jai

Meant to be used in addition to the base modules, not a replacement, mostly. If in doubt, use base module stuff, as there is some overcomplication and shakiness that needs to be worked out here. But, if you find something you like, great!

The structure of these things is still being figured out, many are unfinished and more are to be added. This thing, I guess you could think of it as a flat framework, is being developed alongside several applications, including a nontrivial 3D video game.

The only dependencies are on the jai compiler and base modules. So, much like stb, each of these things can be imported independently. Some modules allow for optional validation elevation, and if so, they require the TeRM_Log module.
